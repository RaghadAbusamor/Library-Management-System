# Library Management System 📚

## Background
A local library is transitioning from traditional book-keeping to a digital system. This project aims to design and implement a robust database system to manage books, borrowers, loans, and more efficiently.

## Objective
Design and implement a relational database using MS SQL that supports the library's operations and offers extensive querying capabilities.

## Requirements
1. Design an Entity Relationship Model (ERM) Diagram.
2. Design the Relational Schema using MS SQL.
3. Build and Seed the Database.
4. Complex Queries and Procedures.

## Seeding Data
Fictional data for the library database was generated using [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/) 🎲, an online data generation tool.

## Entity Relationship Model (ERM) Diagram
The ERD diagram illustrating the entities, attributes, and relationships can shown below 📊

## Database Schema
The SQL script for creating the database schema can be found in `TablesCreation`.

## Seeding Data
The SQL script for seeding the database with fictional data can be found in `SeedingTables`.

## Complex Queries and Procedures
SQL scripts for complex queries and stored procedures are located in the `ComplexQueriesAndProcedures/` folder. 🔍

## Note
- Make sure to adjust database connection settings and file paths as per your environment.
- Use a SQL development tool (e.g., SQL Server Management Studio) to execute the SQL scripts.
